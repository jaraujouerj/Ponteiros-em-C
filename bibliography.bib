	abstract = {From the Publisher: This second editon describes C as defined by the ANSI standard.
	This book is meant to help the reader learn how to program in C. The book assumes some familiarity with basic programming concepts like variables, assignment statements, loops, and functions. A novice programmer should be able to read along and pick up the language. FEATURES: All examples have been tested, which is in machine-readable form. It discusses various aspects of C in more detail, although the emphasis is on examples of complete programs, rather than isolated fragments. It deals with basic
	data types, operators and expressions. Covers functions and program structure, external variables, scope rules, multiple source files, and also touches on the preprocessor.
	It also describes an interface between C programs and the UNIX operating system, concentrating on input/output, the file system, and storage allocation. It also provides a language	reference manual. The official statement of the syntax and semantics of C is the ANSI
	standard.}

	abstract = {From the Publisher:Robert Sedgewick has thoroughly rewritten and substantially expanded
	his popular work to provide current and comprehensive coverage of important algorithms
	and data structures. Many new algorithms are presented, and the explanations of each
	algorithm are much more detailed than in previous editions. A new text design and
	detailed, innovative figures, with accompanying commentary, greatly enhance the presentation.
	The third edition retains the successful blend of theory and practice that has made
	Sedgewick's work an invaluable resource for more than 250,000 programmers! Whether
	you are a student learning the algorithms for the first time or a professional interested
	in having up-to-date reference material, you will find a wealth of useful information
	in this book.}
